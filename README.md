Introducing the groundbreaking device powered by a SIM800L module and NodeMCU: a solution that bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI and traditional communication methods. This innovative device enables seamless access to ChatGPT's advanced capabilities through SMS, catering to individuals who rely solely on basic keypad phones.Designed with inclusivity in mind, this device leverages the power of the SIM800L module to establish a reliable connection to the cellular network. The NodeMCU acts as the intermediary, facilitating communication between the SIM800L module and the ChatGPT API. Through a user-friendly interface, individuals can input their queries via SMS, which are then transmitted to the ChatGPT API.Once received by the API, the device processes the queries and generates insightful and contextually relevant responses. These responses are sent back to the user's keypad phone via SMS, creating a seamless and interactive AI-driven conversation experience. This technology empowers those who may not have access to smartphones to tap into the capabilities of AI, providing a new level of convenience, assistance, and connection.By merging the simplicity of SMS with the sophistication of AI, this device revolutionizes accessibility to information and interaction. It's a testament to the potential of technology to bridge gaps and make AI-driven experiences available to all, regardless of their device limitations.
